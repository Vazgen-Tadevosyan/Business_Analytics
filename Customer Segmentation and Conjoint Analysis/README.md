<h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>
Used bike dataset (bike.xlsx)  to segment customers based on bikes
purchased by applying the k-means clustering algorithm. Analyzed customer segments and provide short
conclusion based on results. Those are the steps I needed to take:<br>

- Transformd the dataset to an applicable data for analysis representing customers in each row, products
(bikes) in column and quantities bought as values.
- Run k-means algorithm and create optimal number of clusters of customers, save the modified data to
an excel file.
- Used Excel to create a final dataset and analyze it (using VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH, pivot tables,
conditional formatting and other formulas and features if necessary).<br>

<h3>Conjoint Analysis</h3>
Coefficients of the regression model ran on ice-cream survey data is provided in the
ice.xlsx. The attributes are ice-cream Flavor (5 levels), Packaging (3), Light (2) and Organic (2). Used the already
analyzed data (i.e. coefficients) to calculate the relative importance of each attribute and stated what is
the highest utility bundle (i.e. what are the levels per attribute that provide highest utilities).
